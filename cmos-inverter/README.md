# CMOS Inverter Simulation – Synopsys Custom Compiler

## 🧠 Project Description
Simulated a CMOS inverter using **Synopsys Custom Compiler** and **SAED 32/28nm PDK** on a Linux environment as part of my VLSI Centre of Excellence training.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Synopsys Custom Compiler
- SAED_PDK_32_28
- Linux Terminal

## 📸 Schematic
_Add schematic image here once uploaded._

## ✅ Output & Observations
- Logic verified: Inverter performs correct voltage inversion
- No DRC errors in layout
- Observed correct waveform transitions (0 ↔ 1)

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- CMOS fundamentals at the transistor level
- Professional toolchain exposure
- Schematic-to-simulation workflow in a Linux environment
